    "### Heuristic way of choosing two $\\alpha$'s\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Osuna's theorem, if at least one of the two Lagrange multipliers violates the KKT conditions, then each step's optimization will increase the objective function. Thus convergence is garanteed. For a faster convergence, Platt introduced a heuristic way to determine the two $\\alpha$'s. ***It includes two steps: first step of choosing $\\alpha _2$ and second step of choosing $\\alpha _1$.***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1. Choosing $\\alpha _2$ which violates the KKT conditions:** This is done by the alternation of two kind of iterations. \n",

    "   * *Iteration 1:* One scan over the entire $\\alpha$'s to find violating $\\alpha$'s. Then go to iteration 2.\n",
    "\n",

    "   * Iteration ends after one scan over the entire $\\alpha$'s and find all $\\alpha$'s obey the KKT conditions within $\\epsilon$. \n",
    "\n",
    "As is clear, this heuristic method wants to concentrate on the non-border $\\alpha$'s, which are more likely KKT-violated. During the optimizing, the border $\\alpha$'s tend to stay at the border, while the non-border ones move as the other $\\alpha$'s are optimized. So we spend most of the time scanning and ajusting the non-border $\\alpha$'s. After all the non-border $\\alpha$'s become self-consistent, we then scan over the entire vector to seach for border $\\alpha$'s which became KKT-violated due to ajusting the non-border $\\alpha$'s.\n",
